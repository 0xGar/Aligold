The library portion of my AliExpress importer for WooCommerce. Given you scrape the JSON from the page (detailed in the soure code), this library will parse it and upload all product details to your website (including category, pictures, and so on). I have a fully functional WordPress plugin version of this program that will do everything for you in one click, but it's buried on an old hard drive. I'll upload it if anyone shows interest in it, though.
